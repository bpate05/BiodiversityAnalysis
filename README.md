# plotlyHW

Using data on belly button bacteria biodiveristy, created interactive visualizations using plotly.js and built a basic webpage. Pushed this onto heroku to host the page as an interactive web application.

Used the following interactive charts:
 * gauge chart
 * pie chart
 * bubble chart
 * table
